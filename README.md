### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes, it definitely helped to prepare me for the assignment, I do wish we had more class time to complete the labs, or even go over them togtether. Specifically when we were transitioning into rendering data utilizing javascript and JSON files, 
easing into the process step by step would have been helpful.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time, I would have definitely added a lot more features. Generally, just features to increase the interactivity and user experience of the site such as adding, editing, and deleting playlists.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I think that my confidence in presenting improved a little more this times, but something I would like to work on for next time is becoming a more engaging presenter, as well as preparing more.

### Open-source libraries used
